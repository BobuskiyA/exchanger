# Developing project

To start developing project, run `dev` NPM Script:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

This will start a Webpack DevServer and open default browser.

The server will watch the changes in project files and refresh the browser it started, so now you can easily dig into some codeðŸ˜Ž
